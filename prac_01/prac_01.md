### Learning Activities & Resources

This week I started creating a boxing themed website for one of my projects. In the process, I delved into the use of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, specifically how to create a responsive website layout using Bootstrap. In order to improve my front-end development skills, I referenced some great online resources:

Bootstrap Official Website Documentation:https://getbootstrap.com/

W3Schools HTML and CSS tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/

YouTube tutorial videos, such as ‘How to Design Responsive Websites with Bootstrap’: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw

### Estimated Hours

I've spent a total of about 3 hours developing this site this week, which includes learning about the technology online, writing code, and testing and tweaking to make sure everything works!

### Content Insights 

In this project, I learnt how to effectively use the Bootstrap framework to create aesthetically pleasing website layouts. In particular, how to use Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive pages that adapt to different screen sizes. I also learnt how to use CSS to spruce up and personalise websites, such as resizing images, adding navigation bars and using cards to display information.

By creating a website on the boxing theme, I not only reviewed basic HTML structure and CSS style application, but also made some initial attempts at more advanced layout techniques. I found that hands-on practice was much more insightful than just watching video tutorials or reading documentation, and this practice was key to my understanding and mastery of my new knowledge.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights 

Through this project, I have learnt the importance of front-end development in website development, which will be very helpful for my future career. The CSS techniques and Bootstrap applications I learnt will directly enhance my web design skills and enable me to create more sophisticated and engaging user interfaces in my future work.

From this week's learning experience, combining practical project exercises with theoretical learning is a very effective learning strategy. This approach has not only improved my programming skills, but has also deepened my understanding of the web development workflow. I plan to continue to use this strategy in my future studies, and to become a more proficient web developer by solving the problems I encounter through practice.
