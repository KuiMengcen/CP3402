### Getting Started with Joomla and Installation

When I first decided to create a website using Joomla, I felt both excited and a little uneasy. I had only a very basic understanding of the platform and knew that it was a powerful content management system capable of creating complex websites.

### The Installation Process

The process of installing Joomla was more complicated than I expected. I encountered several technical hurdles, especially in configuring the database and server settings. After a few hours of hard work and consulting several forums and tutorials, I was able to successfully install Joomla, a process that made me realise that detailed preparation and knowledge of the environment's requirements is crucial.

### Learning to use Joomla

After installing Joomla, I started exploring the Joomla backend interface. At first, I was overwhelmed by the number of options and settings in the interface. By watching tutorial videos and reading the official documentation, I gradually learnt how to add new posts, create menus and modify site templates. I felt a sense of accomplishment with every operation I completed.

### Creating my first web page

My first project was to create a simple personal blog page. After choosing a suitable free template, I started tweaking the layout and design of the site, trying different modules and plugins to enhance the page functionality. I especially liked the ‘Post Manager’ feature in Joomla, which allowed me to easily manage and categorise content.

### Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the learning process, I encountered some challenges such as template customisation not working and some extensions slowing down the site after installation. I gradually solved these problems by checking the Joomla community forums and trying different solutions. These experiences taught me how to find resources and self-help when I encountered problems.

### Summary and Reflection

The Joomla learning journey has been a challenging and growing experience. Not only did I learn how to create and manage websites with Joomla, but I also improved my problem solving and self-learning skills.
