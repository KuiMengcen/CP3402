This week I set out to create a simple boxing-themed website using WordPress. This was my first time using WordPress, so the whole process was new and challenging for me.

### Exploration Phase:
When I first started, I wasn't very familiar with WordPress and felt a little overwhelmed. Luckily, WordPress provides a lot of built-in tutorials and step-by-step instructions, which allowed me to follow the creation process step by step. Through these tutorials, I learned how to choose and install themes and how to do basic page layouts with them.

### Design and Implementation:
I chose a theme that was suitable for showcasing sporting events and began to adapt the design to my needs. Although I encountered some difficulties in my first attempts at layout and design, through hands-on work and constant experimentation, I became familiar with the various tools and functions, such as customising menus, inserting images and adjusting the page structure. By doing it myself, I understood the powerful customisation and flexibility of WordPress.

### Content Creation:
Content writing about boxing was part of the highlight of this project. I wrote articles about the benefits of learning to box in hopes of attracting more visitors interested in boxing. During the content creation process, I also learnt how to optimise article formatting and use keywords to improve search engine visibility.

### Lesson learnt:
Through this learning experience, I not only acquired basic website building skills, but also gained a deeper understanding of the power of WordPress. Although I felt challenged at first, I was able to overcome the difficulties gradually through the systematic teaching steps, which enhanced my self-confidence and problem-solving skills. This experience has not only laid the foundation for my possible future career development, but also inspired me to continue exploring and learning more about web development.
Next, I plan to continue improving the functionality of the website, such as adding interactive elements and enhancing the user experience. Also, I would like to explore more plugins and tools to further optimise the performance and appeal of the website.
